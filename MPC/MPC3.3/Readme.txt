MPC3.3 README FILE  Oct. 11th 2016 -Alex Turpin

Recent MPC_Global3.2 and MPC_Settings3.2 were the primary contstruction for the LARA project which included LARA and NIGK type def structures. 

THis new 3.3 version will include both the global functions and settings files into one. Hopefully this will simplify the program and make for easier modularity in future program construction.
